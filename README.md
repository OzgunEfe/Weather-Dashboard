# Weather-Dashboard
I created an app that allows users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing.

## Weather Dashboard Logic
- I created a weather dashboard with form inputs
- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    - The city name
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed
- When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
- When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
